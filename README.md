# O7_controls_stm32
The software (only the user-defined subset) for the STM32F767ZI microcontroller.

To run software on the controls board, first get the STMCube software from the ST website, or get the condensed version from Daniel. Then, initialize an empty git repository in the top level directory. Set the remote to this repository and pull the most recent commit to get the newest version of the user-edited files. Only user-edited files are stored in the repo, and many other library files are required to run the software.
